Notes about code:

This folder contains the script to test kernel herding algorithms on a mixture of Gaussians (to make Figure 1 and 4 in the paper).

Main script
     - script_test.m -> change d/K/sigma2 at the top to produce some of the plots from Figure 1 & 4 in paper
     [was script_test_MAS.m]

Helper file:
    - random_covariance.m -> generate a random covariance
    (plus others in ../kernel_herding folder)
