# compare_classical_and_graph_discrepancies
#
# This script compares the values of the univariate classical and graph Stein
# discrepancies obtained when samples are drawn i.i.d. from their targets.
# We use non-uniform discrepancies with the best Stein factors drawn from the
# literature to enable comparison with a lower-bounding Wasserstein distance.
